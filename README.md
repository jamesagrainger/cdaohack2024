# Welcome to the 2024 CDAO DE GCP Hackathon!
This hackathon has been designed for in person only across all 3 sites. Please speak with your site rep if you have any questions or concerns. 

## Instructions on the day
- The plan is to split you all into teams (this will be done on the day) based on the dataset that you wish to play around with.
- You will have 3 hours to experiment with the datasets, using whatever services you wish in Stratos (subject to them being enabled in the GenAI env).
- There is no real aim to this, its more of an opportunity for each of you to get more comfortable with the GCP platform and put your learnings into practice. Whether that is:
   - Building a pipeline to ingest, transform and model data
   - Cleaning, transforming and analysing data
   - Visualising data
   - Building ML models for predictions etc.
- After the 3 hours are up, you will come back together and present / share what you have done
- There will be a washup session in the coming weeks to feedback on how you found the experience, so all sites get opportunity to be connected.


We have chosen 3 datasets to be used for the hack. Feel free to use whichever you wish!

1. [Transactional dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1)
   - PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The original logs were provided by a multinational company, who is the provider of the mobile financial service which is currently running in more than 14 countries all around the world.
   - The data is available to download from Kaggle and can be uploaded from your local win365 device.
   - Ideal for basic data analysis and building ML models to predict fraud.
3. [E-commerce dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce?hl=es-419)
   - TheLook is a fictitious eCommerce clothing site developed by the Looker team. The dataset contains information about customers, products, orders, logistics, web events and digital marketing campaigns. The contents of this dataset are synthetic, and are provided to industry practitioners for the purpose of product discovery, testing, and evaluation.
   - The data is available directly through the bigquery public datasets connector in BQ.
   - Ideal for deep dive analytics and potential to build / explore ML modelling. 
5. [Airbnb dataset]() - TBC
