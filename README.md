# Welcome to the 2024 CDAO GCP Hackathon!

This repo has been set up so you can clone it into your Stratos environment and upload the relevant datasets that you wish to use during the hack. We have 3 datasets available:

1. [Financial dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1)
   - PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The original logs were provided by a multinational company, who is the provider of the mobile financial service which is currently running in more than 14 countries all around the world.
   - The data is available to download from Kaggle and can be uploaded from your local win365 device.
   - Ideal for basic data analysis and building ML models to predict fraud.
3. [E-commerce dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce?hl=es-419)
   - TheLook is a fictitious eCommerce clothing site developed by the Looker team. The dataset contains information about customers, products, orders, logistics, web events and digital marketing campaigns. The contents of this dataset are synthetic, and are provided to industry practitioners for the purpose of product discovery, testing, and evaluation.
   - The data is available directly through the bigquery public datasets connector in BQ.
   - Ideal for deep dive analytics and potential to build / explore ML modelling. 
5. [Airbnb dataset]() - TBC
